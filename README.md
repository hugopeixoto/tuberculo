 Minimal Youtube archival tool. Inspired by tubearchivist.


## Background

I wanted a tool to archive the videos in my youtube history, because some of
them tend to be taken down. I found [tuberarchivist](https://www.tubearchivist.com/),
but when I noticed it required both ElasticSearch and Redis, I decided to make
a lightweight version using SQLite3.


## Install

```sh
cargo build --release
```

`tuberculo` requires `yt-dlp` to be installed on the system this is going to run. The binary
will write to `db/` and `videos/` (relative to the CWD). It listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`.
